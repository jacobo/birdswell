		  	</div>
	    	<p><b>Before we went to Ireland, I forgot to post 2 surf sessions:</b></p>
<p><b>8.2.11 - BEST surf session in Nor Cal since we have lived here!</b><span><br>
</span>Jacob and I woke up early and nothing was happening at LM. We continued down to Montara because it seems like if LM is flat then Montara has manageable surf. It looked really clean and uncrowded. When we got there, Chris was already checking the conditions and he said that it looked like a good longboard day.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I brought my 8'6 WRV longboard because my hybrid wouldn't have caught the waves in the same way. </p>
<p>There were so many waves and we all caught some really fun chest to shoulder high waves.</p>
<p>It was perfect conditions…good sized clean waves, no wind and uncrowded. Throughout the day, I kept replaying this session and how amazing it was. A perfect day in Northern California!</p>
<p><b>8.4.11 - Jumbled JT</b><span><br>
</span>I was determined to go surfing before we left for Ireland because I didn't know if we were going to be able to surf over there. Thankfully, we surfed in <a href="http://www.birdswell.com/blogs/blog/3795832-ireland-surfing-lahinch-tramore-8-9-8-11">Ireland</a> and it was wicked awesome!</p>
<p>There were only four of us out at the JT. The other guys were really nice and we even saw some dolphins! It was waist high with some close outs.</p>
<p><b>Surf Sessions after Ireland:</b></p>
<p><b>8.16.11 - Surfing helps me keep my head clear</b><span><br>
</span>Even though we were jet lag, I really needed to go surfing. Surfing is helping me keep my head clear from everything that is going on. Thankfully we have really good friends here for support too.</p>
<p>We got to Montara, and there was swell but not as good as the perfect day that Jacob, Chris and I enjoyed on 8.2.11. It was a little choppy with shoulder high waves.</p>
<p><b>8.18.11 - More Montara</b><span><br>
</span>Montara has been really good lately so we keep going back there and finding some decent swell.</p>
<p>At first, the surf was little wind blown, but the set waves that came through were really fun and fast. By the end of the session, the swell cleaned up and was chest high. We also saw Chris and Tracey out in the line up. It's always nice to see familiar faces.</p>
<p><b>8.19.11 - LM</b><span><br>
</span>I made Jacob get up for yet another surf session. It was drizzling, gray and the water was frigid with a cold breeze. Our expectations were low as the swell was closing out. However, by the time we got in, the waves cleaned up and were really fun! Jacob caught a bunch and I caught a few good ones. The drop ins were fast and mostly shoulder high rights. Denise and Amanda joined us too!<br>

		  	</div>
	    	<p>Last summer, Jacob's dad, Ernie, came back from Ireland and was telling us how great it was. After all his stories, we decided that we should all go as a family. It doesn't take much to convince Ernie to travel or plan a trip. He planned a trip for all of us for Summer 2011.</p>
<p>Surfing wasn't initially part of the trip, but I thought we should bring our wetsuits and booties just in case if we found some swell. We knew there was surfing, but didn't know what spots were the best. Thankfully some locals told us where to go and when the tides were best. I am glad we brought our surf gear because we surfed in two different spots, Lahinch and Tramore. </p>
<p>Lahinch is located near Donegal bay on the west coast. It was mellow knee to thigh high and crowded with surf schools. We rented foamies from a surf truck in the parking lot. We caught a lot of fun ones and Jacob's mom took a bunch of pictures of us!</p>

</p>
<p><br>
Tramore is located on the south of Ireland near Waterford. From the shore, it looked choppy and wind blown. We almost skipped out on surfing but a local, Brent, told us that it has been as flat as a lake until today and that we should surf it. With his advice, we quickly rented a water logged fiber glass board and a foamie. The rental options were pretty sparse. When we got out there the surf was really fun waist to chest high. As the tide rose, the waves and wind got better. Brent joined us on his 10'2 longboard and we all caught fun waves!</p>

</p>
<p>Besides surfing, we have traveled to Doolin to hike the Cliffs of Mohr, climbed on the rocks at "The Burren", whiskey tasting and guiness drinking in Dublin, and Smithwick's Brewery tour in Kilkenny. Ireland is a beautiful country filled with cliffs, castles and cathedrals. The people are so friendly. </p>
<p>I would love to come back some day and find more places to surf. Brent told us about a bunch of good places and that the Fall and Winter are when the best waves arrive. We told Brent that if he was ever in California to look us up and we would love to surf with him again!</p>
<p>While we were in Ireland, one of our good friends from California, Beth, passed away from a sudden brain aneurism. She is in our thoughts constantly and we are anxious to get back to California to see our friends. There will be a paddle out on August 20th to celebrate her life. We miss you, Beth, and are in shock of losing you. We love and miss you!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Costa Rican sunset and waves for you, Beth:<br>

	    	<p><b>7/28 - DP at LM</b><br>
Jacob and I hit LM early and found some clean swell. At first the waves were waist high and by the end of the session the waves were shoulder to head high. The swell definitely got bigger but more closed out during the session. At the end of our session, Amanda arrived and caught some waves with us too. It was a nice surprise! </p>
<p><b>7/29 - LM with Denise</b><br>
We met Denise at LM for dawn patrol and the swell was significantly smaller than the day before. While we were in the water we met a nice girl, December and she surfed with us. She was so happy and very pleasant. I should have brought my longboard since the swell was really small, but I still had a fun session because of the fun people I surfed with.</p>
<p><b>7/31 - Kelly's with Cynthia</b><br>
Jacob and I surf checked from Pacifica to HMB. Montara looked really nice but was so crowded. I have only surfed Montara a couple of times and the rip current is pretty intense. We ended up at Kelly Ave and told Cynthia to meet us there. There was swell and no one else but us!</p>
<p>The drop ins were steep, fast and bumpy and shoulder to head high. We all caught a bunch but Jacob got the wave of the day!<br>

<title></title>

<p>These new shirts are hand-printed by me, using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linocut"><span>lino block</span></a> printing process. Traditionally, BirdSwell has screen printed my artwork onto apparel. Recently, I have fallen in love with the lino block printing process and the aesthetic it creates. I love carving into the lino block and seeing the image appear. In a weird way, carving into the block is very therapeutic. I also love the texture, aesthetic and imperfections lino block printing creates.<span><br>
<br>
</span>Typically, lino blocks are printed on paper, but I am using t-shirts as my canvas. The process produces a very different look and feel for the graphic as compared to traditional screen printing.</p>
<p>Click on the following designs to see the other color options. All of these shirts are made on demand, 100% made in the USA, and each one is unique.</p>

	    	<p><b>7/20/11 - Solo Jetty<br>
</b>Jacob and I were suppose to meet up with Amanda and Denise but we decided to go to the Jetty instead of Linda Mar. LM was crowded and didn't look that great.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the Jetty there was no one there and nice waist high peelers. We decided to stay and had a solo session the whole time!</p>
<p>At first I was riding my 8'6 longboard but switched boards with Jacob. He was riding my 7'6 pintail. I haven't really ridden this board that much because New England didn't have big enough waves to catch. Jetty ramps up and allows a fun drop in. We caught a ton of waves and were pretty excited that it was just us in the water.</p>
<p><b>7/24/11 - Somewhere in HMB</b><br>
Jacob and I have wanted to teach our friends Jay and Rachel how to surf since we moved to California. Jay was able to learn today but Rachel couldn't because of an eye infection. Next time we go she says she wants to learn. Jay did a great job for his first time. He comfortably paddled around, caught white water and stood on the board for a few seconds. He says he wants to go out again to get better. We are excited to take them both next time.</p>
We gathered a great surf crew: Jacob, Chris, Cynthia, Jay, Kyle, Brent and me. We were the only ones at the break. Kyle informed me that it is better on a high tide so the wave can form better off the sand bars. We went at low tide and the waves were shoulder to waist high with really quick fast drops that often closed out. Even though the wave wasn't stellar, it was just our friends out unlike other over crowded spots that we passed by on the way to this more exclusive spot.<br>

After our surf session, I gathered everyone for a BirdSwell photo shoot for the new Lino Block designs that will be released on Thursday, July 28th, 2011.
