				<h1><a href="/blogs/blog/1475182ourtop10ratedfavoritesurfspots">Our Top 10 Rated Favorite Surf Spots</a></h1>
		  	</div>
	    	<p>Hopefully, as we travel more we will add more favorite spots to our list. This is our list so far.</p>
<p>I will be posting our favorite surf spots in sections, 3 spots at a time starting with 10 down to the number 1 spot as its own post. <strong>Disclaimer: These surf spot ratings are based on our surf experiences and not by popular vote.</strong></p>
<p><strong>#10</strong><br>
<strong>Long Sands, York ME</strong><br>
When Jacob and I were getting married, we drove all over New Hampshire to find an ocean front spot. We didn’t find anything that truly fit what we wanted. We continued up the coast to Maine and found a great ocean front spot at Dockside Guest Quarters. We had an awesome wedding and they even let us bring kayaks on to their property. We kayaked away from our wedding in our wedding attire and then paddled around the area with all our friends!</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p><img src="/assets/kayakaway.jpg" alt=""></p>
</div>
<p>The day after we got married we wanted to have a “First Surf as Married Couple Surf Session.” Thankfully there was a perfect surf break five minutes down the road in York, ME called Long Sands. We had surfed there a couple of times when we were looking for a wedding area and thought that this would be the perfect surf session after the wedding. We invited our friends to surf with us as well. It was really special because the guy that taught me how to surf also surfed with us!</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p><img src="/assets/marriedsurfing.jpg" alt=""></p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p><img src="/assets/bettertogetherwave.jpg" alt=""></p>
</div>
<p>As far as the break goes, it is beach break and gets great surf in the fall and winter. The summer time the surf is small and mushy mostly but sometimes kicks up. The crowd is minimal and the locals are really friendly. The water isn’t any colder than New Hampshire.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong><br>
<strong>36th Street – Santa Cruz, CA</strong><br>
The people and vibe in Northern California was awesome. We went to a surf spot recommended by the owner of Paradise Surf Shop. We didn’t know where to go since we had never been there and didn’t know anyone from that area. We were only able to surf for one day because we were busy with other things.</p>
<p>There was a huge crowd on Tuesday mid-afternoon in November. I don’t think I have seen that many people in the line up since Wakiki, HI. Even though there was a big crowd, I was able to catch some great rides. The surf was shoulder high and it wasn’t cold for a November day. It felt like a nice summer day in New England.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong><br>
<strong>Venice Beach, CA</strong><br>
During one of our spring breaks in college, Jacob and I went to Los Angeles, CA to visit his cousin who also surfs. His cousin brought us to a bunch of surf breaks. From the ones I can remember, we surfed El Porto, Zuma, Sunset, Malibu, and Venice. This was our first time out of New England and flying with our surf boards. For me, it was the surf trip that hooked me on the combination of surfing, traveling and finding the perfect longboard wave. It was so exciting and exhilarating to see what another surf town looked like.</p>
<p>All the places that we surfed in the LA area were great. Venice may have made the biggest impression on us because we stayed at a place right on Venice Beach. We did double sessions every day. A morning session at Venice and then a sunset session at a different spot that Jacob’s cousin took us to. We also saw dolphins while we were surfing at Venice. I remember Venice being a colorful town with different artists and had a lot of character. It was interesting to see the old canals (fashioned after Venice, Italy) that were built into the city. We also visited the Zephyr store that use to be run by Jeff Ho. We even bought Zephyr t-shirts as souvenirs.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p><img src="/assets/venice.jpg" alt=""></p>
</div>
<p>I think what makes a great surfing spot or experience are the memories that are made and the waves that were caught. These three spots definitely remind me of some of the happiest moments and that is why they are included in the list.</p>
<p>There are more surf spots to come!</p>
<p>Spread the Swell,<br>

				<h1><a href="/blogs/blog/1466922finallybackinthewater">Finally back in the water!</a></h1>
		  	</div>
	    	<p>After being sick with a cold and waiting for some swell to come to New England, we finally caught some swell yesterday (even if it was small). I am glad we went out because today it is <span class="caps">FLAT</span>…once again.</p>
<p>We surfed at “The Wall” in Hampton, NH where I grew up five minutes away and learned how to surf when I was fifteen. I love this spot and there were only six people out in the water. The summer time is a much different story and that is when we surf other spots.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p><img src="/assets/Feb7th.jpg" alt=""><br>
<br>
(This picture is from <a href="http://www.ralphspic.com/newsletter.html">Ralph’s Pics</a>. I forgot to take my own picture.)</p>
</div>
<p>It was so good to be back in the water even if I have to put on my 6/5 hooded winter suit, 6 mil gloves, 7 mil booties and extra layers of clothing under my suit to keep warm. I sometimes wonder to myself why I suit up and want to go into the 39 degree water in 20 degree temperatures. After I catch my first wave, then it all comes back to me and I remember it is for the love of surfing.</p>
<p>After our session, I felt at ease, happy, and rejuvenated. It felt good to paddle around and get some exercise. It was good to glide down the wave and be one with the ocean again. My family asked me why I would ever want to go surfing in this weather and I can never truly explain to them. They don’t surf so they don’t understand the need to go surfing even in the winter time in New England.</p>
<p>We also checked out a new place in Hampton called Las Olas Taqueria. It was good after surf food. I chowed it down in about two seconds. I recommend it!</p>
<p>Pray for <span class="caps">MORE</span> surf!</p>
<p>Spread the Swell,<br>

	    	<p>Jacob, my husband, his family and I went out to Bend, Oregon for the long weekend. We ski and snowboard, but only took our snowboards for the weekend.</p>
<p>We went to Mt. Bachelor and it was snowing both days. We had fresh powder and found some nice glade trails too. It was so peaceful in the trees and the snow was very fresh and fluffy.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures from our trip:</p>

<p>We returned late last night and woke up to a snow storm. It looks like the snow storm brought in some winter swell. It looks like it will clean up tomorrow! Snowboarding to surfing!</p>

During the drought of waves in cold New England, I was inspired to look back on some of the photos that we have taken during our surf travels. There are even a couple ski/snowboarding travel photos that I was inspired to add in too.</p>
<p>Each of these pictures represents inspiration and memories that we have created through surfing, traveling and enjoying life.</p>
<p>Check them out in the slide show below:</p>

Over time, I will be adding more inspirational photos and if you have any photos or maybe artwork that inspire you…don’t be afraid to share with us! We would love to see what others are inspired by as well!</p>
