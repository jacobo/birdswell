	    	<p>I had a really busy day, but was able to make it out for a sunset session in hopes of meeting up with Cynthia. I couldn't find her anywhere and decided to place myself north of the pump house. I caught a bunch of shoulder to head high lefts and a couple rights. The waves were really clean, offshore and fun!<br>
</p>
<p>This weekend it is suppose to snow at sea level. Apparently, this hasn't happened since 1976. If it snows, it will remind me of New England snowy sessions.</p>

	    	<p>2.22 - Jetty<br>
Yesterday I went for a solo sunset surf session at the Jetty. I arrived and there were only 3 other people out in the water, offshore and clean swell. I was wicked excited and got ready quickly.</p>
<p>I jumped in the water and caught a bunch of waist to chest lefts and rights. Half way through the session, Luke arrived and we caught more waves. It was a long session, but I hadn't surfed in Nor Cal or five days due to stormy weather. It was small, but really really fun session.</p>
<p>2.23 - LM<br>
Jacob and I were suppose to meet Kyle for dawn patrol but Kyle had to bail due to work. Jacob and I were planning the pier, but it was messy so we checked out the Jetty and LM. Jetty was completely flat and LM looked less choppy than the pier. It was a good decision because it cleaned up while we were out there and we caught shoulder to head high waves.</p>

				<h1><a href="/blogs/blog/273986222111sundiegoweekend">2.21.11 - Sun Diego Weekend</a></h1>
		  	</div>
	    	<p>This past weekend (2.19-2.20) Jacob and I went down to San Diego for 3 different reasons.</p>
<p>1. To watch Alicia (Jacob's sister) in her Ultimate Frisbee tournament for University of Florida.<br>
<br>
2. <b>Spread the Swell! </b><br>
• We delivered BirdSwell shirts to <b>Island Surf Coronado </b>(if you are in Coronado, CA you should check out this store - really cool stuff!)<br>
• We also secured a new store, <a href="http://www.surfysurfy.net/"><b>Surfy Surfy</b> </a>in San Diego. BirdSwell shirts will be in their store very soon!
</p>
<p>3. SURF!!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We had a great time watching Alicia play Ultimate:<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/photo.JPG"><br>
Alicia is in white<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We surfed two spots, Scripps and we don't know the other name but it was in Leucadia:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/photo-1.JPG"><br>
Scripps</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Scripps was rough, choppy and had a really short swell period. It was tough getting pass the breakers so we caught smaller waves on the inside. We decided we should find a different spot and found clean, offshore lines in Leucadia. I was glad that we decided to switch spots because we were much more successful. It was clean shoulder to head high waves and a ton of fun! </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We caught a bunch of fun, sunny, warm waves, but I wish I had my new board, Tweetie P because the waves were perfect for that board. I had an 8'6 crappy rental but managed to catch waves. Jacob rode a sweet 6'8 Bonzer that JP at Surfy Surfy let us try out. It had 4 glassed in mini fins and a 6.5 inch fin in the middle.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/assets/fins_sharp.jpg"><br>
Exactly like this but on a yellow board</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: left;">In other exciting news, we were accepted to be in two Festivals. Come check us out!<br>
1. Ring into Spring in Santa Cruz, CA - March 13 <br>
2. Fog Fest in Pacifica, CA - September 24-25</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: left;">We also just got int a store in San Francisco located in Haight called, SoMe. They are all about supporting new and local t-shirt artists in SF. It is a funky store with a lot of character.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: left;">We had so much fun in San Diego and hope to return soon. California is so diverse and so much fun. We love it here!</div>

		  	</div>
	    	<p>Jacob and I planned on surfing less crowded spots as we knew that Linda Mar and the Jetty would be packed on a Saturday. The forecast also said the swell was going to be really small in those areas.<br>
</p>
<p>We met up with Luke and Dugen south of the Jetty and caught some chest to shoulder high lefts. At the begining of the session, the waves were decent but the end of the session the waves were blown out and the tide was too high. Jacob, Dugen and I headed over to LM to meet up with our friend Chris and caught knee to ankle high tiny crowded waves. It was a short session since we were meeting some of Jacob's co-workers in SF for beer week events.</p>
<p>It was a fun day of surf, friends, food and beer.</p>

		  	</div>
	    	<p>Jacob, Kyle and I dawn patrolled at the Pacifica pier today. We haven't been surfing at the pier too much because it is always huge and gnarly. It looked smaller than usual so we were excited to try it on a "small" day. Once we paddled out, the waves were NOT so small. They were over head and half and the bigger set waves were double over head on Jacob and Kyle. The waves always look smaller from the beach!</p>
<p>The biggest challenge that we all faced was the constant current pulling us towards the pier. Personally, I was tired from trying to get out of the rip current. When I went for a wave, my paddled power was depleted and I wasn't dropping in. The drop ins are also really steep.</p>
<p>Kyle decided to paddle in and walk a lot further down to the next peak so he wouldn't be stuck in the current. Jacob followed suit and I finally found a spot that wasn't pulling me. Kyle caught a wave for a second and then fell and paddled in. I decided to paddle in with him because I was not catching anything. Jacob caught one really nice long ride and he also dropped in on a wave that could have been a disaster. He took a double over head wave that he was teetering on and we thought he was going to go over the falls. Thankfully, he made the insane drop in on his stomach. Kyle and I looked at each other and were screaming in excitement. I was so glad that he made it and didn't wipe out. When he paddled in, he was filled with so much adrenalin. 
</p>
<p>For me, the pier has been my biggest surf spot challenge. I realize that it is probably over my ability, but I live a block away and I really want to keep on trying to get waves there. I am happy that I am even courageous enough to try it. I haven't been courageous enough to try Ocean Beach yet. I hear that it is a really crazy paddle and waves.</p>
<p>I want to keep on challenging myself and take on surf spots that will make me a better surfer on bigger waves. Eventually, I will figure out the pier and prevail! </p>
