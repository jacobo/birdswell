		  	</div>
	    	<p>Here are the next 3 surf spots in the series of “Our Top 10 Rated Favorite Surf Spots” <br>
<em>Disclaimer: These surf spot ratings are based on our surf experiences and not by popular vote.</em></p>
<p><strong>#4</strong><br>
<strong>Punta de Mita, Mexico</strong><br>
We just got back from San Pancho, Mexico and it was a great trip! We heard that Salyulita was the place to go, but we really loved Punta de Mita aka: La Lancha. Awesome longboard waves that consistently broke to the right. The rides were extremely long and clean. It was a bit crowded at times, but it may have been because we went during the holiday season. I have a feeling that during the off season the crowd is small and local.</p>
<p>The best part of surfing at Punta de Mita was seeing a whale breach and also a whale’s tail. It was the first time I had ever seen a whale while surfing. It was unreal and amazing.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">

</div>
<p><strong>#3</strong><br>
<strong>Puraran Bay, Philippines</strong><br>
I was born in the Philippines and was adopted when I was very young. Jacob and I went to the Philippines for our Honeymoon. It was the first time back since I was born. We heard that Puraran Bay on the island of, Catanduanes was the surf spot to check out. While we were traveling around, we also checked out Bagasbas on the island of Luzon. Waves were super small and they told us that we should come back in a month and it would be bigger surf (during typhoon season like hurricane season here in New England)</p>
<p>Puraran was a secluded paradise! The water was so warm and barely anyone was there. I didn’t even wear a rash guard, but probably should have since I got a horrible sunburn. There were a couple of Australians waiting for the big swell to come, but it was good enough for us! The owner of the place that we were staying at was kind enough to let us take out his longboards. The surf was chest to shoulder high. It was a great reef break and really easy to catch. We caught a bunch of nice smooth rides. We were the only ones on the lonely reef and we were completely stoked about it!! In addition to surfing, there was a really nice snorkeling area on the way to the reef. We saw some pretty cool fish and star fish too. It was a beautiful place and I plan to return as soon as I can.</p>

<p><strong>#2</strong> <br>
<strong>Playa Esterillos, Costa Rica</strong><br>
Costa Rica is an amazing place! We have been 3 times and have planned another trip with our friends in March (2010). There is so much to do there and the surfing is phenomenal. We fky into San Jose and then head over to Jaco. We usually stay in Playa Hermosa, but we love surfing at  Playa Esterillos. It is not as well known as Playa Hermosa, but it isn’t crowded and feels more local. The swell is always consistent, 4-5 feet – shoulder to head high and clean! Nice longboard waves.</p>
<p>At the beginning of one of our surf sessions, we were heading for the water and a local came running at us shouting “Crocodillio!” Apparently there was a salt water crocodile in the water. We never actually saw the ‘crocodillio’ but we weren’t about to take our chances. We took his advice, and didn’t go in until he told us that we were in the clear.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p><img src="/assets/playaesterillos.jpg" alt=""></p>
</div>
<p>We are off to Costa Rica this Saturday in hopes of Spreading the Swell and bringing our shirts down there. I am also excited to go with friends and teach some of them how to surf!</p>
<p>Spread the Swell,<br>

				<h1><a href="/blogs/blog/1490732dartbostonpokinholesshow">DartBoston Pokin' Holes Show</a></h1>
		  	</div>
	    	<p>We were on a show called, “Pokin’ Holes” hosted by <a href="http://dartboston.com/">DartBoston</a> at <span class="caps">SCVNGR</span> offices in South Boston this past Thursday.</p>
<p>DartBoston Pokin’ Holes is a live web cast and show that is held every Thursday in at different venue in the Boston area.</p>
<p>A young entrepreneur(s) (20 something) pitches their company and then a panel of other 20 somethings (usually entrepreneurs) “poke holes” in the company and give advice/suggestions on how to take your company to the next level and grow. The audience also takes part with questions and suggestions.</p>
<p>It was a great opportunity to hear about people’s thoughts and what they thought we could do to grow BirdSwell. We definitely going to take some of the suggestions and put them into action.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the show <a href="http://dartboston.com/pokin-holes-ep38-birdswell/">here.</a></p>
<p>Here are some pictures from the night as well:</p>

		  	</div>
	    	<p>Here are the next 3 surf spots in the series of “Our Top 10 Rated Favorite Surf Spots” <br>
<strong>Disclaimer: These surf spot ratings are based on our surf experiences and not by popular vote.</strong></p>
<p><strong>#5</strong><br>
<strong>Hawaiian Army owned &amp; locals only surf spot (I forget the name)</strong><br>
When I went to Hawaii, I went with my sister and grandmother for 10 days. At the time, my sister was working for the army as a wild life biologist conserving land on the island of Oahu. Of course, I begged her to bring me with her! Thankfully, she agreed and also had special access to Army owned beaches.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p><img src="/assets/1174496172_8_normal.jpg" alt=""></p>
</div>
<p>I rented a long board from a local shop on the beach. It was a reef break which required me to paddle for a long time but it was so worth it. I caught some uncrowded chest high long rights. I felt like I was in heaven. I remember this local Hawaiian girl that was ripping it up and I was in awe of her wave riding. She was probably in high school or maybe junior high but surfed like a pro. At times, I found myself just watching her prowess on the waves and remember how I longed to surf like her one day.</p>
<p>The other tourists thought I was Hawaiian (thanks to my Polynesian (Filipina) roots). They asked me about the area and where the best places to surf were. I would laugh to myself then tell them it was my first trip to Hawaii and I didn’t know very much about the area.</p>
<p>Hawaii truly has the aloha spirit. The people are awesome and so friendly. I definitely want to get back to Hawaii as soon as I can. Jacob has never surfed in Hawaii so it would be great to go together.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong><br>
<strong>Boca Barranca, Costa Rica</strong><br>
Boca Barranca is a great long board wave. It is long, clean and not crowded. It is a gentle wave waist to chest high. We were the only surfers in the line up. We have heard that the river inlet that runs into the ocean can bring in pollution, but when we were there the water looked really clean. This spot holds a famous longboard competition in Costa Rica as well. It is somewhat off the beaten path, but thanks to our Costa Rican guide book we were able to find it.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p><img src="/assets/1174744896_157_normal.jpg" alt=""></p>
</div>
<p><strong>#7</strong><br>
<strong>Secret Spot in Massachusetts</strong><br>
We recently learned of this secret spot. It is the best place to go when other surf spots in MA are closed out, choppy and messy. It is sheltered and literally hidden away from the human eye. The swell is a clean right break, shoulder to head high and a fairly gentle wave to catch. We saw one short boarder in the line up, but it is more of a longboard wave. Other times we have gone it has just been us and no one else in the line up.</p>
<p>The other thing that makes a great surf spot for me is if the break is not crowded. I love being in the ocean with a few other people.</p>

				<h1><a href="/blogs/blog/1476922wintersession21210nahantma">Winter Session 2.12.10 - Nahant, MA</a></h1>
		  	</div>
	    	<p>When I woke up today, I checked the surf and it looked so nice. I was debating on doing yoga, running or going surfing. Surfing won! Surfing is so much better than running on a treadmill…that’s for sure! I like yoga for many reasons, but surfing trumps yoga.</p>
<p>Jacob wasn’t able to go with me today, but that wasn’t going to stop me from getting some sweet swell. It was 35 degrees, sunny and the water was 39 degrees. For about 45 minutes, I was the only one out in the line up and then two guys came out. It was chest/shoulder high, smooth drop ins and clean longboard lines. It was great being out in the ocean by myself. It was so serene and I could pick and choose any wave that I wanted. I didn’t have to watch out for other surfers and it was so quiet. I think I saw about 3 people on the beach with their dogs.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures from my 2 hour session:</p>

<p>I am so glad I hit the swell, but now time for a meeting and getting shirts into more surf shops!</p>
<p>Have a great weekend!</p>
