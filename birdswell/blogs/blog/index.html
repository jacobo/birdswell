				<h1><a href="/blogs/blog/6735670newsurfboardjellybelly">New Surfboard: Jelly Belly</a></h1>
		  	</div>
	    	<p>I collaborated with my ding repair man, Rich Wood (Woody) to make my newest custom surfboard. The new board is modeled after my friend, Denise's surfboard. I got a 7'0 hybrid board. It is shaped mostly like a short board besides the middle where it is fat and wide. It is 2.75 inches thick,  22.5 inches wide, pointy nose with a rocker to get into stepper waves.<br>
<br>
I created the jellyfish art work and his new shaping company is called, North Coast Surf Designs. I wanted to support Woody's new business and help it grow. <a href="http://surfergrrrl.blogspot.com/">Cynthia</a> helped me name my board. I knew I wanted Jelly in there, but she added the belly cause of the middle thickness and width. I think it is very fitting!</p>

				<h1><a href="/blogs/blog/6704768hawaiiantriphighlightsoctober210">Hawaiian Trip Highlights (October 2 – 10)</a></h1>
		  	</div>
	    	<p><b>10.2<br>
</b>When we booked our Hawaii trip, one of my top priorities was to get a koa wood Hawaiian ukulele. I brought my empty ukulele case. After we got settled in, we stopped into a shop in Waikiki. I tested out a bunch of ukuleles including one that was $2500! The one I loved the most was made by <a href="www.koaloha.com">KoAloha</a>. Jacob looked up KoAloha and realized that their warehouse was 15 minutes outside of Waikiki. When we got there, they were making ukuleles and met the CEO of the company. There was a small shop next to the warehouse. I tested out 4 different soprano ukuleles and decided to buy one! I got a great deal (half off) from the original price! Awesome people, ukuleles and company!</p>
<p><b>10.3<br>
</b>We got up for DP to surf with Chris Butler. Chris aka: Crib use to live in SF bay area, but he and his wife, Piyada recently relocated to Hawaii. They use to work at Stanford but now work at Hawaii Pacifica University. We met him in Waikiki and surfed Canoes. After he left, we decided to paddle out to 1st peak and caught some really beautiful long waves. I love surfing without a wetsuit!</p>
<p>We were invited by James and Jackie to have dinner at Jackie's Uncle Randy (aka: Pineapple) house. We had a homemade Hawaiian feast. Jackie gave us a ginger flower and tea leaf leis made by her grandmother. Uncle Randy has a lemon , tangerine and orange tree and took some back to our condo. We also had fresh starfruit and jabong from Jackie's grandmother's tree. It was an awesome night!</p>
<p><b>10.4<br>
</b>We got up for DP at 1st peak again, but the waves were not as good as yesterday. We still caught some nice ones, but they were not consistently rolling in. We saw a sea turtle so that made the session better.</p>
<p><b>10.5<br>
</b>We didn't go surfing today, but we had Leonard's malasadas (yum!!), met Jackie's grandparents and went to their house to get fresh fruit off their trees. We wish we could grow vegetables and fruits as easily as they can. It's hard being on the coast with cooler air.  We are so jealous of their plentiful fruit tree oasis. It is absolutely gorgeous and amazing! </p>
<p>Jackie, James, Jacob, Uncle Pineapple and I went to on a hike to Manoa Falls. It was beautiful and the forest is so lush! After our hike, we met grandpa and grandma at Helena's Hawaiian Food. They have the most amazing Pipikaula short ribs. HOLY JABONG the food is amazing and authentic Hawaiian food. I feel so lucky that we hung out with locals and that they were so willing to show us around to the best local places.</p>
<p><b>10.6<br>
</b>We surfed for 4 hours with Chris Stolte. The waves were really fun! He is also here for the Aloha Ruby Conf. We went to Canoes at first, but it was too crowded for me so we paddle out to 1st peak again. I met a local guy, Monty and he was super nice. He thought I was from Hawaii but I told him "I wish!" When I told him I am I from San Francisco he said, "San Francisco surfers are the real surfers because they have guts to surf in cold water!" </p>
<p>After surfing, we met up with Jackie and James and snorkeled at Hanauma Bay. The bay is really beautiful and the reef is filled with beautiful fish. A sun filled day.</p>
<p><b>10.7<br>
</b>We didn't go surfing today. We were going to, but I didn't feel that great. I think I got too much sun the day before. After I slept for awhile, we managed to go to the Hawaii Fishing and Seafood Festival. We ate Big Island Abalone and other assorted seafood. After the festival, we went over to Jackie's Aunty Sheryl's house for another feast! We met more of her family. Her family is so kind and took us in.</p>
<p><b>10.8<br>
</b>We went for a quick DP surf before Jacob went to Aloha Ruby Conf. I also had a ton of work to do. The swell was really mushy and bumpy. It was easier for us to get out of the water today.</p>
<p><b>10.9<br>
</b>We met up with Denis (aka: @AREAsurf on twitter) for DP and surfed Diamond Head, Cliffs. I had only ever talked to him via Twitter so it was great to meet him! He is awesome! We had a great session and caught a lot of beautiful waves. I love reef breaks! The waves roll perfectly off the reef.</p>
<p><b>10.10<br>
</b>We met up with Stolte, Wes and Rich (all of which were at the Aloha Ruby Conf) for DP and surfed Canoes and then paddled out to 1st peak before we flew back to the mainland. Monty was already there and we said our good bye. He is super nice! <br>
<br>
I caught one of my best Hawaiian waves. I was in really good position and the wave peaked up off the reef. I only had to do one stroke into the wave and I on it. The waves are mellow with fun steeper drops.<br>

	    	<p><b>9.22.12 The Hook</b><br>
<b>Time: </b>Afternoon<br>
<b>Surfed with:</b> Jacob, Seemant<br>
<b>Swell Height: </b>Waist - Chest<br>
<b>Swell Condition: </b>some bumpy, some clean rights<br>
<b>Board: </b>9'0 Maroon Platoon
</p>
<p><br>
<b>Session Highlights:<br>
</b>Seemant hadn't been surfing since January due to a neck injury. He wanted to get back out and Jacob wanted to go to Santa Cruz. We went to Capitola first but the tide was too high. The swell was not happening there. We drove over to The Hook and joined a large crowd of beginners on wave storms and foamies.</p>
<p>I met a guy named, John in the water and he said he grew up on the east coast, but had been in California for 30 years. We reminisced about hurricane season. We caught some party waves together. The tide was high making some crumbly waves, but caught a lot of fun ones. </p>
<p>Seemant caught his best wave since he started learning! I was so stoked for him. He caught another one after that too!</p>
<p><br>
<b>9.24.12 Happy Birthday Marcia!<br>
</b><b>Time: </b>Dawn Patrol<br>

<p><b>Session Highlights:</b></p>
<p>When I paddled in at LM, Marcia was there! She arrived early for her birthday surf before work.</p>
<p>Right when I got into the line up after saying hello to Marcia, I caught a left overhead high wave that made my whole session. I caught a few more, but not as good as the first wave of the day.</p>
<p><br>
<b>9.25.12 LM<br>
</b><b>Time: </b>Dawn Patrol<br>
<b>Surfed with:</b> Jacob, Marcia, Ed<br>
<b>Swell Height: </b>Waist  - Chest<br>

<b>Board: </b>7'10 Tweetie P<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b>Session Highlights:</b></p>
<p>Marcia told us that she was going to paddle out at LM for DP again. We decided to go out too. The swell was a little smaller at first, but as the tide changed the waves quality got a lot better. </p>
<p>There were a lot of people out, but got a lot of good waves!</p>
<p><br>
<b>9.29.12 Humble Pie<br>

	    	<p><b>9.8.12 Accidental Surf Safari</b><br>
<b>Time: </b>Afternoon<br>
<b>Surfed with:</b> Jacob, Darren<br>
<b>Swell Height: </b>Chest<br>
<b>Swell Condition: </b>Clean Rights<br>
<b>Board: </b>7'10 Tweetie P
</p>
<p><b>Session Highlights:<br>
</b>Jacob, Darren and I went out to check the waves in San Mateo county and everything was blown out. We traveled down the lonely coast and everything looked crappy. At that point, we decided to go to Santa Cruz and commit. We ended up at The Hook. There was a large crowd, but we all found some great waves.</p>
<p>My wave of the day was on a head high right. Jacob and Darren said they saw me catch it. I had to do a couple long swooping bottom turns to miss the other surfers. Thankfully, no one dropped in on me and I was able to ride the wave all the way to the shore from the point. It was worth the paddle back. This wave will definitely be put in as one of my most memorable waves.</p>
<p><br>
<b>9..11 LM<br>
</b><b>Time: </b>Dawn Patrol<br>
<b>Surfed with:</b> Jacob<br>
<b>Swell Height: </b>Waist to Chest<br>
<b>Swell Condition: </b>Fast quick drops into closeouts<br>
<b>Board: </b>7'10 Tweetie P</p>
<p><b>Session Highlights:<br>
</b>We wanted to surf our favorite spot, but it looked really big and heavy. We ended up at LM and it was an ok session. Jacob brought 7'6 Blue Squirrel instead of 9'8 Verde. I was shocked! He said it was a good change and challenge. He was glad he brought it since the waves weren't that great. The waves were quick, fast and zippy drops. I am excited to get my new 7'0 board so I can catch the wave faster and move down the steep wave quicker. Tweetie P is fast and gets the drop but sometimes the length makes me stall on the wave.<br>

<b>9..12 NEMO<br>
</b><b>Time: </b>Dawn Patrol<br>
<b>Surfed with:</b> Jacob, Darren, Cynthia<br>
<b>Swell Height: </b>Waist<br>
<b>Swell Condition: </b>Cleaner shoulders but still a lot of close outs<br>
<b>Board: </b>7'10 Tweetie P</p>
<p><b>Session Highlights:<br>
</b>The swell dropped a little with a cleaner shoulder. Cynthia brought her 5'4 fish "Nemo" which is as tall as me. Jacob and I both tried it and WOAH was it hard! I felt like a kook and sloppy. I felt like I was learning how to surf again. When I sat on the board, it sunk disappearing into the water. I barely caught 2 waves on it and my arms were so tired from paddling. I felt like this board would be a good size for a child. Even though I completely sucked on it, I want to try it again. I was humbled and challenged, but had blast on it.</p>
<p>We were also suppose to meet up with Zach (whom I have never met. We know him via Twitter) but he was no where to be found. We are starting to think he is "the phantom of the ocean."<br>

9.16.12 Back in New England<br>
</b><b>Time: </b>Dawn Patrol<br>
<b>Surfed with:</b> Jacob, Ed<br>
<b>Swell Height: </b>Thigh<br>
<b>Swell Condition: </b>Clean long rights<br>
<b>Board: </b>Ed's 8'4 hull (yellow fatty)</p>
<p><b>Session Highlights:<br>
</b>Jacob and I went back to the east coast to visit our family and friends. We hadn't seen them since Christmas time. I am very close with my family and friends. My friends become like family to me. I have known some of my friends since grade school. It was so great seeing them all. I have gotten some friends to move west, but I want all my family and friends to move west (definitely won't happen, but I can dream). I really miss them all a lot. Thankfully, we have made some amazing friends in California that are becoming like family. I have told Jacob, "When you become my friend, there is no escaping! You are my friend forever." I really value my relationships with people.</p>
<p>Anyway, Jacob contacted his old boss, Ed. We use to surf with him a lot when we lived in Massachusetts. We met him at Nahant in Massachusetts and he brought boards for us. He brought an 11 foot hull shaped by Andreini for Jacob and an 8'4 yellow hull shaped by Ryan Lovelace for me. I shall call the 8'4 "yellow fatty". Jacob loves this 11 foot board and is probably going to get one very similar to it. The board I rode was really wide with thin rails. It was a different experience, but was easy getting into the wave which allowed me to catch a lot of nice long rights. The swell was small, but the quality was perfect…glassy, peeling with all rights.<br>

<b>9.17.12 Straws, NH <br>
</b><b>Time: </b>Dawn Patrol<br>
<b>Surfed with:</b> Jacob<br>
<b>Swell Height: </b>Chest high<br>
<b>Swell Condition: </b>Clean long rights<br>
<b>Board: </b>Ed's yellow 8'4 board</p>
<p><b>Session Highlights:<br>
</b>Since we don't have boards on the east coast, Ed let us borrow his boards for a couple more days. We woke up early to surf Straws in New Hampshire. When we got there, the line up was filled with Stand Up Paddle boarders (SUP). NH has really embraced SUPs. It makes sense because NH doesn't get swell all year round. SUPing is a good alternative to surfing on flat days. However, when there is swell, I wish there were less SUPs only because it can be dangerous on a heavier swell. </p>
<p>The line up wasn't crowded, but the swell was bigger and there was a nice right off the sandbars. It was glassy, peeling with rights and lefts.</p>
<p>I will always love these surf spots. New Hampshire is where I learned how to surf and I will always go back to see my family. I will always love the east coast.</p>

<b>Time:</b> Dawn Patrol<br>
<b>Surfed with:</b> Jacob, Tim<br>
<b>Swell Height: </b>Knee - Waist<br>
<b>Swell Condition: </b>Rights<br>
<b>Board: </b>Red Wonder 8'6
</p>
<p><b>Session Highlights:<br>
</b>Our friend, Tim stayed over to hit dawn patrol with us. He doesn't surf as often as we do, but wants to! We are happy to help him get the stoke. Today, the size was small, but the quality of the wave was really nice. I got a lot of nice longboard rights. I took Red Wonder out and I forgot how much fun this board is on nice longboard waves. I had a blast!<br>

<p><b>8.29.12 - Jumblaya<br>
</b><b>Time:</b> Dawn Patrol<br>
<b>Surfed with:</b> Jacob, Chris G, Tracey, Manabu<br>
<b>Swell Height: </b>Head High <br>
<b>Swell Condition: </b>Rights and Left, jumbled<br>
<b>Board: </b>Maroon Platoon 9'0</p>
<p><b>Session Highlights:</b></p>
<p>One word to sum of this surf session: FRUSTRATION!</p>
<p>I caught a wave right away and went all the way to the beach. I caught another one but it wasn't that great. THEN, a BIG lull in catching waves. I would go for the wave, but didn't catch it. It would either just keep rolling or I just plain would not get it. Like I said, "FRUSTRATION!"<b></b></p>
<p>Jacob cut his toe on his fin and sat out for the last 10 minutes while I struggled to catch my last wave. I finally caught a zippy left. This was probably one of my worse sessions in awhile.<b></b></p>
<p><b>9.1.12 - Steep Drops<br>
</b><b>Time:</b> Mid Morning<br>
<b>Surfed with:</b> Jacob, Luke<br>
<b>Swell Height: </b>Head High <br>
<b>Swell Condition: </b>Point Break - Lefts<br>
<b>Board: </b>Tweetie P</p>
<p><b>Session Highlights:<br>
</b>Jacob and I stumbled out of bed and found a mouse in our house! After that annoyance, we decided we should go surfing. We've taken care of the situation as best we can and haven't seen another mouse since Sunday. We are having another exterminator come and plug up all the holes underneath our house so the mice won't be our roommates. ugh!</p>
<p>On our search for swell, we passed Luke on route 1. He called and we told him to join us. We checked a secret spot in our area and decided to give it a go. There was no one else out and the waves looked decent.</p>
<p>Luke and I caught waves right away. We both had smiles on our face and said it was worth it! Jacob was struggling, but he was also sitting way outside. He should have moved a bit more on the inside. Once he did, he hit his fin on an rock and broke his fin off! First his fin cuts him and now his fin breaks off. He is not having good luck lately.</p>
<p>We all caught more waves, but my first and last waves were my best.</p>
<p>I truly love sessions when the line up is just friends. It is comforting, friendly and fun. I am not a big fan of crowds.</p>
<p><b>9.3.12 - Labor Day Crowds<br>
</b><b>Time:</b> Mid Morning<br>
<b>Surfed with:</b> Jacob, Tim, Jessica, Chris, Mattie, Asma<br>
<b>Swell Height: </b>Shoulder High<br>
<b>Swell Condition: </b>Rights and Lefts<br>
<b>Board: </b>Tweetie P</p>
<p><b>Session Highlights:<br>
</b>We were going to meet up with our regular surf crew, but decided to go with some of Jacob's old and current co-workers. We hadn't surfed with them in awhile. It was fun!</p>
<p>Asma asked us if we could take her surfing. We took her to LM and we probably should have taken her somewhere else. I think LM is probably one of the worse places to take a beginner. It is crowded and the white water area is not long enough to stand up in. Also, I am too short to stand up in the shallows so I get tired and bashed by the white water. From now on, we are taking people somewhere else!</p>
<p>While Asma took a break, I caught a bunch of waves. They were really fun. The crowd was heavy, but a lot of people at LM just sit there and don't catch anything. Some people call the people bobbing around and not taking waves, "surf buoys".</p>
<p>After surfing, Tim (now Jimbo) and I jammed out on the ukulele. I think we convinced Jessica to get a ukulele too. We are going to start our own ukulele cult (that's right cult not band!)<br>

<p><b>9.5.12 - Overhead Glassy Joy<br>
</b><b>Time:</b> Dawn Patrol<br>
<b>Surfed with:</b> Jacob<br>
<b>Swell Height: </b>Head - Overhead<br>
<b>Swell Condition: </b>Rights and Lefts<br>
<b>Board: </b>Maroon Platoon</p>
<p><b>Session Highlights:<br>
</b>I literally sprinted to the swell because I was so excited to see glassy, calm, nearly perfect swell at one of my favorite spots. Also, there was no one out yet! Eventually, other people joined but only about 6 others.</p>
<p>The first wave I caught was just the ocean and me. It was so awesome…perfect.</p>
<p>When the other people joined, dolphins surfaced and a guy yelled, " Oh good, protection from sharks." My thoughts were, "Don't say the "S" word while in the water!" UGH! I like Cynthia's rule: "Never speak the name of The One Who Must Not Be Mentioned while in the water!"</p>
<p>We caught so many good waves. I think this is one of the better sessions I have had lately. The south west swell seems to be sticking around. </p>
<p>WAVES!</p>
<p><b>9.6.12 - You are my happy<br>
</b><b>Time:</b> Dawn Patrol<br>
<b>Surfed with:</b> Jacob, Luke, Cynthia, Chris, Tracey<br>
<b>Swell Height: </b>Chest to Shoulder, Occasional Head High<br>
<b>Swell Condition: </b>Rights and Lefts<br>
<b>Board: </b>Maroon Platoon</p>
<p><b>Session Highlights:<br>
</b>At first, the tide was too high creating short swift rides ending with close outs. Once the tide changed, the waves were really glassy with a fun shoulder to ride on.</p>
