				<h1><a href="/blogs/blog/5191852candidreflectionwhydidicreatebirdswell">Candid Reflection: Why did I create BirdSwell?</a></h1>
		  	</div>
	    	<p>I created BirdSwell because I needed a creative outlet for myself apart for my design consulting business. BirdSwell is a combination of all my passions: surf, art, design, color, drawing, ideation and I could keep going. BirdSwell brings me so much happiness and invigorates me just like surfing does. BirdSwell has introduced me to so many interesting people in the surf community that have also become great friends and surfing buddies. If it weren't for BirdSwell, I probably wouldn't have met these amazing people and friends.</p>
<p>Through BirdSwell, I have more freedom to do what I want to do. I get to surf more often and create art that I want to create.</p>
<p>I love when a surf shop or a person buys a BirdSwell product and is so excited about the artwork and product. It really excites me that they love my artwork and my passion. </p>
<p>BirdSwell is my gift and offering to the world. It is my stamp on the world. It is my creation. It is my voice.  </p>
<p>Spread the Swell,<br>

				<h1><a href="/blogs/blog/48883524straightdaysofsurfing">4 straight days of surfing!</a></h1>
		  	</div>
	    	<p>After almost 3 weeks off because of Thanksgiving and sickness, Jacob and I got back into the water. We surfed 4 straight days with our friends, Tara and Morgan, visiting from Washington State. They went to college with us at Northeastern in Boston and moved to Washington this past September.
</p>
<p>We went surfing at the JT, LM, and SC. Some of our CA surfing pals also joined us for our sessions. The waves at the JT and LM were shoulder to head high and SC was waist to shoulder longboard rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/P1020171.jpeg"><br>
Luke, Tara, Morgan, Jacob, J-Bird in Santa Cruz (picture taken by <a href="http://surfergrrrl.blogspot.com">Cynthia</a>)</p>
<p>We are planning on going up to Washington and surfing their break. They say that it is much colder with short period swell. It should be like surfing back in New England on a day when a hurricane arrives.</p>
<p>Also, for the month of December we are donating 10% of all the sales to <a href="http://www.savethewaves.org/">Save the Waves Coalition</a>. Please help support this great organization! </p>

	    	<p><b>11.10.11 - Glassy Montara<br>
</b>Linda Mar was completely flat, but this usually means that Montara will have some nice swell. Jacob and I checked it out and there were some nice sets coming through. Denise met up with us and expressed that she usually hates going to Montara because of the crazy, big and messy waves and rip currents. We convinced her that it wouldn't be crazy today because the swell is flat everywhere else.
</p>
<p>She and I headed down to the beach and she was still nervous. Right when we got in, I caught a nice glassy chest high left. Denise got excited and shouted, "I want one of those!" The next wave that came rolling through, she and I caught it together and she was so excited. She was happy that we convinced her to try Montara on a calm day. </p>
<p>We all caught a bunch of glassy chest high rights and lefts. It was a great uncrowded session. </p>
<p><b>11.11.11 - LM Strong Offshore Winds<br>
</b>Jacob and I met up with Darren and Noah at LM. It wasn't looking that great so we drove down to the JT which was even worse! Darren told us that he has never seen the JT so bad so we headed back to LM. The offshore winds picked up but we still got in. Half way through our session, it started to rain and got even more windy. The crowd was heavy with people trying to catch waves but getting bumped off of them because of the strong winds.</p>
<p>At this point in the session, my goal was to catch 1 wave. I was on the 7'3 board so I was messing up a bunch of waves. I finally caught a nice shoulder high right and a random guy came up to me and said, "That was a sweet wave!" I thanked him and set a goal to catch just 1 more wave. About 10 minutes later, I caught another one and decided to call it a day.</p>
<p>Jacob was on his longboard and caught a bunch but had to paddle really hard to get into the waves to beat the wind.</p>
<p><b>11.13.11 - JT Church of Surf<br>
</b>Cynthia just got her <a href="http://surfergrrrl.blogspot.com/2011/11/downsizing-hmb-jetty.html">new short board, Rocket</a> shaped by Ward Coffey. I was excited for her and wanted to see her new board. However, we arrived late at the JT and only saw her for a couple of waves. She caught 2 nice ones and then went in. Rocket is pretty sweet!!</p>
<p>I brought the 7'3 (still working on the name) and got into a bunch of really fun waist to chest high waves. I am getting better at turning and maneuvering the board. It is less wobbly and a lot of fun! <br>
<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/JT_1.jpg"></div>
<p>I told Jacob that he is boring because he always uses the same old longboard. However, this session he brought Tweetie P and also rode the 7'3. He was great on both boards!</p>
<p><b>Side Note:<br>
</b>I have been doing some personal strength training specifically for my legs. I have had a bad left knee/leg from over doing it with running. This past year I stopped running altogether and my legs have really weakened. During my time with my trainer, I am doing a lot of leg strengthening, but I am also doing some great surf related exercises too. They are hard to explain, but they are making my upper body strong too! I really feel like it is helping me pop up faster while surfing.</p>

	    	<p><b>11.2.11 - Offshore LM<br>
</b>Jacob and I went to LM and there were strong offshore winds. We ran into Amanda in the line up and we agreed that we should have worn our gloves because our hands were freezing! It seems like the winter water temperatures arrived over night. I have been taking Tweetie out more often because the bigger and steeper Fall waves have arrived.</p>
<p><b>11.6.11 - Sun, Friends and JT<br>
</b>Cynthia, Jacob and I met up at the JT. Cynthia and I realized that we haven't surfed together since mid September! I was happy to get back in the water with her. Nikki joined us later in the session.</p>
<p>I took Tweetie out and Jacob took out our friend Denise's 7'3 board out. I was really surprised that he wanted to take it out and not his beloved longboard! One of the great things about surfing in California is that you can try a bunch of different boards because the swell is bigger and steeper. I have tried boards from 6'4 to 9'8 this past year. I am finding that I enjoy boards in the 7' range for winter swell and 8'6 + for small summer swell. We are lucky to have friends with all different size boards so we don't have to buy boards but can borrow them.</p>
<p>Half way through the session, Jacob and I switched boards. I was skeptical that I would be able to catch waves on the 7'3, but I was able to drop in really easily on the board. I wasn't as stable standing on the board, but the drop ins were great. I am hoping to borrow the board a little longer and learn how to turn better on the board. </p>
