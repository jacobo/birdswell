	    	<p>Jacob and I went to San Diego for a short surf trip with our surf crew, Nikki, Luke, <a href="http://surfergrrrl.blogspot.com/">Cynthia</a> and Scott from July 15th until July 18th.</p>
<p>Jacob and I flew down on July 15th and stayed at his cousins, Shiva and Nicole in LA. Luke and Nikki drove from SF to LA with a truck load of surfboards…10 to be exact! Jacob brought, Maroon Platoon (9'0 Modern High Performance Longboard) and I brought Tweetie P (7'10 Ward Coffey Hybrid) for the weekend. We thought we were going to rent a Bonzer from Surfy Surfy but we didnt' have time to get to the surf shop. Jacob wanted to bring, Verde (9'8 Hap Jacobs Longboard) but it was too long for the truck. We were happy with our board choices.</p>
<p><b>7.16 - Topanga in LA<br>
</b>Our first session was in LA at Topanga which is a really sweet longboard point break. Cynthia and Scott didn't arrive until later so they didn't join us but Jacob, Luke, Nikki and I caught some chest to waist glassy rides. It was a beautiful sunny 72 degree day. <br>
<br>
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

<br>
  <div style="text-align: left;">After we were done surfing at Topanga, we drove down to La Jolla, SD to meet up with Cynthia and Scott. We stayed at a vacation home located half a block from Windansesa point break. We rested from the 2.5 hour drive. We got restless and went out for another surf session. The waves were mushy, peaky and chest to waist high. Sun setting, thinner suits and no booties is a great way to end the day!<br>

  <div style="text-align: left;">
<b>7.17 - Windansea</b><br>
  We got up for a morning session at Windansea and it was still jumbled, mushy with waist to knee high waves. It was still really fun because the water was really warm and we were the only ones in the line up. Sometimes I prefer less desirable waves with only my surf buddies. I am not a fan of crowds especially when people can be territorial and aggressive.<br>

    <div style="text-align: left;">Jacob and I only did one surf session because we went to visit our friend's from Northeastern (college) that live in Southern California. They just had a baby and bought a new house. We thought it was a perfect opportunity to see them.<br>

      <div style="text-align: left;">After our visit with our friends, Cindy and Keith, we met up with Nikki, Cynthia and Scott for a Pirate Ship Sunset Cruise in the San Diego Harbor. Luke opted out of the cruise. We planned this trip at a pirate themed bar called, Smuggler's Cove in San Francisco and thought it would be fitting to extend the theme and go on a Pirate Ship in San Diego.</div>

<p><b><br>
7.18 - AMAZING San Onofre!</b><br>
Luke and Nikki had to drive back from SD to SF so they wanted to hit the road early so they could avoid traffic. We got up early and drove an hour north to San Onofre for one last but the best surf session of the whole trip!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/sanO.jpeg"><br>
(picture taken by <a href="http://surfergrrrl.blogspot.com/">Cynthia</a>)<br>
<br>
</p>
<div style="text-align: left;">Honestly, this picture does not do these waves justice. These waves were seriously awesome and warm. Glassy, super long, point break, semi-crowded, warm water, waist to chest and occasionally shoulder high waves. We were ALL having a blast on these peelers. I think we all definitely got our best waves here. It was a great way to end the trip. The sun came out later in the day and we were all just ranting and raving about how much fun we had. I caught a super long right that made me stoked for the rest of the day. Sessions like this one is why I am addicted to surfing. Last time Jacob and I were at San O, we had a great session with his cousin Shiva. <br>
<br>
Since our flight wasn't until later at night, Jacob and I went to LA to visit his cousin, Shiva at his work, <a href="http://www.trashforteaching.com/">Trash for Teaching</a>. Shiva was suppose to meet up with us at San O for an early morning surf but he had to be to work early. We went out to eat for some spicy tofu at a Korean restaurant. It was delicious! After we took a tour of the Trash for Teaching facility and met some of his co-workers. It was really fun seeing him and hope he will surf with us next time.<br>
<br>
I had such a great time with my Nor Cal surf crew. When we first moved here, these were the friends that took us out for our first session, Cynthia, Luke and Nikki. I met them through Twitter and I am so glad that we all connected because they have made moving 3,500 miles away from all our friends and family a really smooth transition. I am so thankful that we know them, surf with them and now travel with them. Great times had by all!</div>

		  	</div>
	    	<p><b>7/8 Back in the Water!</b><br>
After a 2 week hiatus out of the water due to work and taking a trip to the East Coast to see my friends and family, I surfed LM with Jacob and Denise. I got in before them and caught a bunch of fun waist high waves. Once they got in, the line up got more crowded. We all caught some really fun waves and at the end of the session we saw Luke and Carolina.</p>
<p><b>7/10 - Sunday Fun Day!</b><br>
Cynthia gathered the surf crew (Nikki, Jacob, Luke and me) and we all met at the JT for some shoulder high crowded waves. I dropped in on some really fun and fast lefts. Jacob saw one of my waves from the front (which is rare) and said that it was one of the best waves he has seen me catch in awhile. We all caught fun waves but the crowd was heavy.</p>
<p>Next weekend Jacob and I are heading down to San Diego to visit friends, family and surf! We are going with Cynthia, Luke and Nikki. We are also hoping Jacob's cousin, Shiva will join us for a surf session. We will also be seeing our good friends from college, Cindy and Keith. They bought a new house that we have yet to see and just had a baby 2 weeks ago. I am really excited to see them and meet their new baby!</p>

	    	<p><b>6.20 - </b><b>International Surf Day<br>
</b>International Surf Day is a day where surfers from all over the world celebrate surfing, the surfing lifestyle, and the oceans, waves and beaches that we love so much. So wherever you are, make sure to take time-out, get in the water and go for a surf.</p>
<p>Jacob and I celebrated International Surfing Day with an early morning session at Bunnies Beach. We saw at least 10 bunnies on our way to the surf. We dropped in on some steep shoulder to head high surf and we were the only ones in the water. It was a peaceful beautiful morning.</p>
<p><b>6.22<br>
</b>Jacob and I surfed LM with Denise. We met her mid morning and the waves holding up with nice chest to head high left shoulders. There was an offshore wind that blew us north. Denise and I party waved and had a great time!</p>
<p>Jacob tried Denise's 6'0 fish and caught a couple waves, but was definitely a challenge and different experience. He kept saying that he needed a longer floatier board. He loves longboarding so switching up is definitely different for him. I am going to try it later this week to see how I do on it. </p>
<p><b>6.25<br>
</b></p>
<p style="display: inline !important; ">Jacob, Denise and I went to Bunnies Beach and caught a couple head high waves but the swell was really bumpy and some steep drops off of the sandbars. Denise wasn't as comfortable and said she was going to head to the JT. W</p>
e decided to join her to catch waist high crowded swell.
<p>This upcoming weekend I am heading back to the East Coast to see family and friends. I may try to go surfing if there is any swell. Summer in the East Coast is usually not very big and sometimes people call it "Lake Atlantic." I hope that there will be some swell and that I get to ride with some old friends!</p>

		  	</div>
	    	<p><b>6.15<br>
</b>Jacob and I met up with Amanda at LM and there were a lot of people there because of a paddle out for a fire fighter that passed away.</p>
<p>The waves were really big on the north side but boat docks was breaking really nicely. Darren was already in the water surfing and said he had caught a bunch of nice lefts.</p>
<p>Amanda and I moved a little to the north to catch a little stepper wave since we didn't have our longboards. It was a pleasant morning with shoulder high waves.</p>
<p><b>6.16<br>
</b>I drove north to Bolinas to drop off BirdSwell shirts at 2 mile surf shop. I had never been there before so Drew (owner of 2 mile) told me where to go to find some surf.</p>
<p>I caught so many beautiful clean knee to chest high rights. Darren told me to bring a longboard and I am glad I took his advice because the waves were perfect for a longboard.</p>
<p>There were a lot of older guys there and they were really fun. One guy I talked with told me he had been surfing Bolinas for 37 years. He also told me that in the 70's he bought 2 acres of land for only $27,000!</p>
<p>On the way to and from Bolinas, I was overwhelmed with happiness because I realize that I live in such an incredibly beautiful place with really awesome people. I also had a deer cross in front of my car. Bolinas is so majestic with the giant cliffs going down into the ocean. </p>
<p><b>6.18<br>
</b>I had such a great time at Bolinas that I took Jacob back so he could check it out too. Our friends Sarah, Denise and Joel joined us. Sarah and Joel didn't surf but Denise did.</p>
<p>Jacob and I started out at the patch because I had an amazing time there on Thursday. Denise decided to surf the groin. We should have followed Denise's lead because the groin was breaking much better than the patch. We surfed the patch for an hour and then surfed the groin for another hour. We caught a lot of fun chest high lefts at the groin and bumpy knee high waves at the patch. We also saw Dugen and Judy as we were leaving and they were arriving to surf. </p>
<p>I hope to go back to Bolinas with Jacob when the patch is breaking better. He didn't experience how magical the patch can be.</p>

		  	</div>
	    	<p>Besides doing BirdSwell, I am also a graphic design consultant. Lately, I have been really busy designing for all my clients which has been great! Designing and Surfing are my two favorite things to do! </p>
<p>Anyway, May and June have been windy, but there have been a few great sessions.</p>
<p>Here is an update of the past 2 weeks.</p>
<p><b>5/30<br>
</b>Jacob and I were being lazy all day long for Memorial Day, but decided to go for a sunset session. We ended up at Bunnies beach and caught some really great waves. There was only one other person out with us.</p>
<p><b>6/2</b><br>
Jacob and I hit Linda Mar and the waves were ok.</p>
<p><b>6/4</b><br>
Jacob's temporary co-worker, Jonas (from Sweden) really wanted to try surfing before he returned home. We took him to the Jetty along with Monty. Monty was here about 2 months ago but recently moved here because Jacob recruited him from his old work in Boston to his new work in SF. He just arrived 2 weeks ago. He plans to surf with us a lot so he can get better since he is a beginner.  Nikki, Cynthia, and Denise (my colleague) also joined us. <br>
<br>
The waves at the Jetty were horrible. We lasted for about 45 minutes and then Jonas, Monty, Jacob and I ended surfing at LM with really fun but crowded waves. Jonas said he really enjoyed surfing and was really tired after surfing for 4 hours. </p>
<p><b>6/8<br>
</b>We were suppose to meet up with Amanda but LM was blown out. She decided to skip and go into work instead. Jacob and I went to the Jetty and there were a couple good waves but nothing too exciting.</p>
<p><b>6/12<br>
</b>We went to Santa Cruz with Monty and met up with a new friend, Nicole. She just picked up surfing in January and is still learning. When we got to Santa Cruz the waves were beautiful. We got in right away and we stayed in for 4.5 hours catching waist to chest high glassy surf. It was really crowded, but we managed to catch a ton of waves. We also saw Denise, Sarah, Kyle and Jonathan in the line up. <br>
<br>
It was one of the best surf sessions I have had in awhile. Lots of paddling, but lots of fun longboard rides. I am never disappointed when I surf in Santa Cruz. FUN TIMES!</p>
